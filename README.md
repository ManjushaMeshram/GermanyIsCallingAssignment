# Germany Is Calling Application

Hello, This is the Germany Is Calling Assignement Report:

**Test Execution Steps:**


Step: 1) Created two feature files in gharkin language under "src/main/java/features" folder which are as follows:
				 
        a. Login Success Feature (GermanyLoginFailure.feature)

        b. Login Failure Feature (GermanyLoginSucces.feature)

        c. Login Failure Feature with Empty Input (GermanyLoginEmptyInput.feature)

Step: 2) Created Germany Login Page file under "src/main/java/pages" folder, File name is "GermanyLoginPage" which includes the Initialization of Page Elements

Step: 3) Created class file for Step Definition under "src/main/java/stepdefinition" folder which includes all the test case method initialization 	
		 			
      a. GermanyLoginSuccess_stepdifinition.java

      b. GermanyLoginFailure_stepdifinition.java

      c. GermanyLoginFailureEmptyInput_stepdifinition.java
     
			
Step: 4) Created Test Runner file under "src/main/java/testrunner" folder, file name as "RunPurnaTest.java"


**Assumptions:**

While completing the assignment I assumed that, I will complete the task using BDD Framework "properties file" which will provide the input values to the all execution steps. I have tried that way also, but I failed there.


**Additional Information:**

First of all, Thank You so much for giving me the chance for the completion of task. As a beginner, I havent used yet a github "README.MD" file. Just because of this assignment I have got a chance to learn and use that type of files. 

I understand that, I need to work more on BDD Framework.
